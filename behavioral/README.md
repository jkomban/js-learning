Behavioral Design Pattern
    * Concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate

    1. Observer Pattern
        - Allows a collection objects to watch an object and to be notified of changes
        - benifit : Allows a loosely coupled system
    2. Mediator Pattern
        - Controls communication between Objects, so neither has to be coupled to the others
        - One object manages all communication
        - Publisher / Subscriber is an example - PubSub
    3. Command Pattern
        - Encapsulate the calling of a method as an object
        - Fully decoupling the execution from the implementation
        - less fragile than the other two patterns
